[Dotnet Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) is required to run that version of the streaming server.

## Running the Servers

The NodeJS server runs on port 3000 and the DotNet server is on port 5000.

To run the NodeJS server:

```sh
node ./server.js
```

To run the DotNet server:

```sh
